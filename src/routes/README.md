## Security Features

### Route Guards
- **GuardProtectedRoute**: Validates user authentication and role permissions
- **Role-based Access Control**: Each route checks for specific role permissions
- **Automatic Redirects**: Unauthenticated users redirected to login
- **Fallback Routes**: Unknown roles redirect to appropriate default pages

### Layout Security
- **Isolated Layouts**: Each role has its own layout preventing cross-role access
- **Context Protection**: User context validates permissions at component level
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Role-specific navigation prevents unauthorized access

## Implementation Details

### Protected Route Logic
```typescript
switch (role) {
  case UserRole.ADMIN:
    // Admin gets admin routes + customer routes
  case UserRole.MANAGER:
    // Manager gets manager routes + customer routes
  case UserRole.STAFF:
    // Staff gets staff routes + customer routes
  case UserRole.CONSULTANT:
    // Consultant gets consultant routes + customer routes
  case UserRole.CUSTOMER:
    // Customer gets customer routes only
}
```

### Layout Components
- `src/layouts/admin/` - Admin layout with management sidebar
- `src/layouts/manager/` - Manager layout with oversight tools
- `src/layouts/staff/` - Staff layout with content management
- `src/layouts/consultant/` - Consultant layout with consultation tools
- `src/layouts/customer/` - Customer layout with personal tools
- `src/layouts/main/` - Public layout for unprotected pages

### Route Configuration Files
- `src/routes/protected/access/adminPermission.tsx`
- `src/routes/protected/access/managerPermission.tsx`
- `src/routes/protected/access/staffPermission.tsx`
- `src/routes/protected/access/consultantPermission.tsx`
- `src/routes/protected/access/customerPermission.tsx`

## Usage Examples

### Adding New Routes
1. Add route constant to `src/consts/router.path.const.ts`
2. Create page component in appropriate `src/pages/[role]/` directory
3. Add route to respective permission file
4. Update sidebar navigation in layout component

### Role-based Navigation
```typescript
// Example: Adding a new consultant route
{
  path: "new-feature",
  element: <NewFeaturePage />,
}
```

### Page Protection
All protected routes automatically include:
- Authentication verification
- Role permission checking
- Loading states
- Error handling
- Automatic redirects

## Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users only access features needed for their role
2. **Hierarchical Access**: Higher roles include lower role capabilities
3. **Consistent Layout**: Each role has consistent navigation and layout
4. **Security First**: All routes protected by default, public routes explicitly defined
5. **User Experience**: Clear role-based navigation with appropriate branding

This routing structure ensures secure, scalable, and maintainable access control for the drug prevention community support platform.
